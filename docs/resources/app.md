# digitalocean\_app

Provides a DigitalOcean App resource.

## Example Usage

To create an app, provide a [DigitalOcean app spec](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/references/app-specification-reference/) specifying the app's components.

### Basic Example

```hcl
resource "digitalocean_app" "golang-sample" {
  spec {
    name   = "golang-sample"
    region = "ams"

    service {
      name               = "go-service"
      environment_slug   = "go"
      instance_count     = 1
      instance_size_slug = "professional-xs"

      git {
        repo_clone_url = "https://github.com/digitalocean/sample-golang.git"
        branch         = "main"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Static Site Example

```hcl
resource "digitalocean_app" "static-ste-example" {
  spec {
    name   = "static-ste-example"
    region = "ams"

    static_site {
      name          = "sample-jekyll"
      build_command = "bundle exec jekyll build -d ./public"
      output_dir    = "/public"

      git {
        repo_clone_url = "https://github.com/digitalocean/sample-jekyll.git"
        branch         = "main"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Multiple Components Example

```hcl
resource "digitalocean_app" "mono-repo-example" {
  spec {
    name    = "mono-repo-example"
    region  = "ams"
    domains = ["foo.example.com"]

    # Build a Go project in the api/ directory that listens on port 3000
    # and serves it at https://foo.example.com/api
    service {
      name               = "api"
      environment_slug   = "go"
      instance_count     = 2
      instance_size_slug = "professional-xs"

      github {
        branch         = "main"
        deploy_on_push = true
        repo           = "username/repo"
      }

      source_dir = "api/"
      http_port  = 3000

      routes {
        path = "/api"
      }

      run_command = "bin/api"
    }

    # Builds a static site in the project's root directory
    # and serves it at https://foo.example.com/
    static_site {
      name          = "web"
      build_command = "npm run build"

      github {
        branch         = "main"
        deploy_on_push = true
        repo           = "username/repo"
      }

      routes {
        path = "/"
      }
    }

    database {
      name       = "starter-db"
      engine     = "PG"
      production = false
    }
  }
}
```
