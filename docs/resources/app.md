# digitalocean\_app

Provides a DigitalOcean App resource.

## Example Usage

To create an app, provide a [DigitalOcean app spec](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/reference/app-spec/) specifying the app's components.

### Basic Example

```hcl
resource "digitalocean_app" "golang-sample" {
  spec {
    name   = "golang-sample"
    region = "ams"

    service {
      name               = "go-service"
      environment_slug   = "go"
      instance_count     = 1
      instance_size_slug = "professional-xs"

      git {
        repo_clone_url = "https://github.com/digitalocean/sample-golang.git"
        branch         = "main"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Static Site Example

```hcl
resource "digitalocean_app" "static-site-example" {
  spec {
    name   = "static-site-example"
    region = "ams"

    static_site {
      name          = "sample-jekyll"
      build_command = "bundle exec jekyll build -d ./public"
      output_dir    = "/public"

      git {
        repo_clone_url = "https://github.com/digitalocean/sample-jekyll.git"
        branch         = "main"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

    domain {
      name = "foo.example.com"
    }

    alert {
      rule = "DEPLOYMENT_FAILED"
    }

    # Build a Go project in the api/ directory that listens on port 3000
    # and serves it at https://foo.example.com/api
    service {
      name               = "api"
      environment_slug   = "go"
      instance_count     = 2
      instance_size_slug = "professional-xs"

      github {
        branch         = "main"
        deploy_on_push = true
        repo           = "username/repo"
      }

      source_dir = "api/"
      http_port  = 3000

      routes {
        path = "/api"
      }

      alert {
        value    = 75
        operator = "GREATER_THAN"
        window   = "TEN_MINUTES"
        rule     = "CPU_UTILIZATION"
      }

      log_destination {
        name = "MyLogs"
        papertrail {
          endpoint = "syslog+tls://example.com:12345"
        }
      }

      run_command = "bin/api"
    }

    # Builds a static site in the project's root directory
    # and serves it at https://foo.example.com/
    static_site {
      name          = "web"
      build_command = "npm run build"

      github {
        branch         = "main"
        deploy_on_push = true
