# digitalocean\_spaces\_bucket_object

Provides a bucket object resource for Spaces, DigitalOcean's object storage product.
The `digitalocean_spaces_bucket_object` resource allows Terraform to upload content
to Spaces.

The [Spaces API](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/spaces/) was
designed to be interoperable with Amazon's AWS S3 API. This allows users to
interact with the service while using the tools they already know. Spaces
mirrors S3's authentication framework and requests to Spaces require a key pair
similar to Amazon's Access ID and Secret Key.

The authentication requirement can be met by either setting the
`SPACES_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `SPACES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables or
the provider's `spaces_access_id` and `spaces_secret_key` arguments to the
access ID and secret you generate via the DigitalOcean control panel. For
example:

```
provider "digitalocean" {
  token             = var.digitalocean_token

  spaces_access_id  = var.access_id
  spaces_secret_key = var.secret_key
}

resource "digitalocean_spaces_bucket" "static-assets" {
  # ...
}
```

## Example Usage

### Create a Key in a Spaces Bucket

```hcl
resource "digitalocean_spaces_bucket" "foobar" {
  name   = "foobar"
  region = "nyc3"
}

resource "digitalocean_spaces_bucket_object" "index" {
  region       = digitalocean_spaces_bucket.foobar.region
  bucket       = digitalocean_spaces_bucket.foobar.name
  key          = "index.html"
  content      = "<html><body><p>This page is empty.</p></body></html>"
  content_type = "text/html"
}
```

## Argument Reference

-> **Note:** If you specify `content_encoding` you are responsible for encoding the body appropriately. `source`, `content`, and `content_base64` all expect already encoded/compressed bytes.

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - The region where the bucket resides (Defaults to `nyc3`)
* `bucket` - (Required) The name of the bucket to put the file in.
* `key` - (Required) The name of the object once it is in the bucket.
* `source` - (Optional, conflicts with `content` and `content_base64`) The path to a file that will be read and uploaded as raw bytes for the object content.
* `content` - (Optional, conflicts with `source` and `content_base64`) Literal string value to use as the object content, which will be uploaded as UTF-8-encoded text.
* `content_base64` - (Optional, conflicts with `source` and `content`) Base64-encoded data that will be decoded and uploaded as raw bytes for the object content. This allows safely uploading non-UTF8 binary data, but is recommended only for small content such as the result of the `gzipbase64` function with small text strings. For larger objects, use `source` to stream the content from a disk file.
* `acl` - (Optional) The canned ACL to apply. DigitalOcean supports "private" and "public-read". (Defaults to "private".)
* `cache_control` - (Optional) Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain Read [w3c cache_control](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9) for further details.
* `content_disposition` - (Optional) Specifies presentational information for the object. Read [w3c content_disposition](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1) for further information.
* `content_encoding` - (Optional) Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field. Read [w3c content encoding](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11) for further information.
* `content_language` - (Optional) The language the content is in e.g. en-US or en-GB.
* `content_type` - (Optional) A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data, e.g. application/octet-stream. All Valid MIME Types are valid for this input.
* `website_redirect` - (Optional) Specifies a target URL for [website redirect](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html).
* `etag` - (Optional) Used to trigger updates. The only meaningful value is `${filemd5("path/to/file")}` (Terraform 0.11.12 or later) or `${md5(file("path/to/file"))}` (Terraform 0.11.11 or earlier).
* `metadata` - (Optional) A mapping of keys/values to provision metadata (will be automatically prefixed by `x-amz-meta-`, note that only lowercase label are currently supported by the AWS Go API).
* `force_destroy` - (Optional) Allow the object to be deleted by removing any legal hold on any object version.
Default is `false`. This value should be set to `true` only if the bucket has S3 object lock enabled.

If no content is provided through `source`, `content` or `content_base64`, then the object will be empty.

-> **Note:** Terraform ignores all leading `/`s in the object's `key` and treats multiple `/`s in the rest of the object's `key` as a single `/`, so values of `/index.html` and `index.html` correspond to the same S3 object as do `first//second///third//` and `first/second/third/`.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported

* `etag` - the ETag generated for the object (an MD5 sum of the object content). The hash is an MD5 digest of the
  object data. For objects created by either the Multipart Upload or Part Copy operation, the hash is not an MD5
  digest. More information on possible values can be found on [Common Response Headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonResponseHeaders.html).
* `version_id` - A unique version ID value for the object, if bucket versioning is enabled.
